Phase 1: Extract Data and Utilities (Week 1)
- Move hardcoded data to separate configuration files
- Create utility functions for common operations
- Extract type definitions to separate files

Phase 2: Create Sub-components (Week 2-3)
- Start with smallest, most isolated components
- Create and test each sub-component individually
- Ensure props interface matches parent component needs

Phase 3: Refactor Main Components (Week 4)
- Replace inline code with sub-component imports
- Update state management to work with new structure
- Maintain exact same props interface for backward compatibility

Phase 4: Testing and Optimization (Week 5)
- Add unit tests for each sub-component
- Performance testing and optimization
- Code review and documentation updates

Phase 5: Cleanup (Week 6)
- Remove unused code and imports
- Update documentation
- Final testing and deployment

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:
- NO changes to CSS classes or styling
- NO changes to component props interfaces
- NO changes to visual layout or behavior
- Maintain 100% backward compatibility
- All existing imports must continue to work
